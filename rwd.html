  <h1>article header h1</h1>
  <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br>
    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,<br>
    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p>
  <h2>article header h2</h2>
  <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the<br>
     readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using<br>
     Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,<br>
     as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.</p>
  <h2>article header h3</h2>
  <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available,<br>
     but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour,<br>
     or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.<br>
     If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to<br>
      be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.</p>

        <p>Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32<br>
           and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"<br>
          (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in<br>
          45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics,<br>
          very popular during the Renaissance. The<br>
        first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor<br>
         sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
